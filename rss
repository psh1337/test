A Check Point Security Gateway sits between an organizationâ€™s environment and the Internet to enforce policy and block threats and malware. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for credential access to local accounts due to an arbitrary file read vulnerability. Other sensitive files such as SSH keys and certificates may also be read. Depending on the privileges associated with the accounts, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Local accounts that are configured to have fewer rights on the system could be less impacted than those that operate with administrative rights.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 20:17:28 Z</pubDate></item><item><link>https://www.cisecurity.org/advisory/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-google-chrome-could-allow-for-arbitrary-code-execution_2024-064</link><title>Multiple Vulnerabilities in Google Chrome Could Allow for Arbitrary Code Execution</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Chrome, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution.
